# SLECA
SLECA, an integrated single-cell transcriptomic atlas for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), consolidating data from eight studies comprising 366 samples. The atlas is built upon the SarsGT model, a graph transformer–based framework that identifies rare cell types and computes attention scores to quantify gene importance at the cellular level.
